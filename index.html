                <p>In 1946, Ahidjo entered territorial politics. From 1953 to 1957, Ahidjo was a member of the Assembly of the French Union.[5] From 28 January 1957, to 10 May 1957, Ahidjo served as President of the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon.[11] In the same year he became Deputy Prime Minister in de facto head of state Andr√©-Marie Mbida's government. In February 1958, Ahidjo became Prime Minister at the age of thirty-four after Mbida resigned.[5] He was reassuring towards the Church and the Muslim aristocracies in the north of the country and succeeded in embodying the union of conservative currents concerned about the growing number of protest movements in the 1950s</p>
